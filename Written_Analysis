There is a relatively strong correlation bewteen latitude and temperature. The lower latitudes have higher temperatures and the higher latitudes have lower temperatures.
The correlation between latitude and wind speed is very weak, thought it appears the wester part of the hemisphere has stronger winds.
Temperature increases as the latitude approaches the equator (latitude 0).
Humidity is more concentrated at higher values as the latitude approaches the equator (latitude 0).
